## ANTs-related background

* Sandy, Brian, and <span style="color:red;">DiReCT</span>
    + used other tools such as FMRIB Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST)
    + `KellySlater.cxx`
* pipedream scripts "adequate for Penn data."
* `KellyKapowski.cxx` and `antsCorticalThickness.sh`
* _"Let's evaluate on open data."_
* and, eventually, _"Let's compare with FreeSurfer."_


## Basic components of the pipeline

1. template building (offline)
2. brain extraction
3. cortical thickness estimation
4. cortical parcellation


## Sample results

## The ANTs structural brain mapping workflow

## Template building

*Tailor data to your specific cohort*

![](./evaluation/figures/templates.png)

* Templates representing the average mean shape and intensity are built directly from the
* cohort to be analyzed, e.g. pediatric vs. middle-aged brains.
* Acquisition and anonymization (e.g. defacing) protocols are often different.

## Template priors

![](./evaluation/figures/templatePriors.png)

Each template is [processed](https://github.com/ntustison/antsCookTemplatePriorsExample)
to produce auxiliary images which are used for brain extraction and brain segmentation.

## Brain extraction comparison

![](./evaluation/figures/brainExtraction.png)

Comparison with de facto standard FreeSurfer package.  Note the difference in separation of
the gray matter from the surrounding CSF.  (0 failures out of 1205 scans)

## Brain segmentation

![](./evaluation/figures/brainSegmentation.png)

Randomly selected healthy individuals.  ```Atropos``` gets good performance across ages.


## Cortical thickness maps

![](./evaluation/figures/corticalThicknessEstimation.png)

In contrast to FreeSurfer which warps coupled surface meshes to segment the gray matter,
*ANTs* diffeomorphically registers the white matter to the combined gray/white matters
while simultaneously estimating thickness.

_But without ground truth, how does one evaluate the pipeline?_




## Predict age and gender

$AGE \sim VOLUME + GENDER + \sum_{i=1}^{62} T(DKT_i)$

## Open science principles

![](./evaluation/figures/ageDistribution.png)

* Public data sets (IXI, NKI, OASIS, MMRR)
* $>$ 1200 subjects, age 4 to over 94 years old

## Prediction from cortical thickness data

## Age prediction per site
